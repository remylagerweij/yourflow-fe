## Todo

[] - Case cards show 3 (1 and 3 should be cut off)
[] - Case cards animation should move them out of the view, not switch places with each other. Visually you always see 3 cards but it should scroll through them.
[] - Add swiper support to case cards to scroll through them
[] - Move gradient animation on top of the cases (pass through clicks so cases can be interacted with) so that it appears like the cases are actually fading out
[] - Hero c2a needs to be in front of the gradient
[] - 'YourFlow text' in Hero can have animated gradient
[] - Make expandable Navigation (HSO.com as example)
[] - Generate white png company logo's per case
[] - Unify the buttons (hero, about and navigation)
[] - Add photo's to homepage
