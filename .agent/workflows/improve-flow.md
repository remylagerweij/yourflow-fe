# Improve Flow Workflow

This workflow uses **UX Design Skill** section: User Flow.

> [!TIP]
> Use `view_file` to read `.agent/skills/ux-design/SKILL.md` section 1 (User Flow).

## Steps

1.  **Identify the Flow**
    - What user journey are we improving?
    - What's the goal the user is trying to achieve?

2.  **Flow Audit**
    - [ ] Is the purpose immediately obvious?
    - [ ] Are there unnecessary steps?
    - [ ] Are error states handled gracefully?
    - [ ] Is there a clear "happy path"?

3.  **Friction Points**
    - [ ] Confusing labels or copy?
    - [ ] Too many form fields?
    - [ ] Missing confirmation for destructive actions?
    - [ ] Poor empty states?

4.  **Improvements**
    - Simplify: Remove unnecessary steps.
    - Clarify: Improve labels and messaging.
    - Guide: Add progress indicators, success feedback.
    - Prevent: Add validation before errors happen.

## Common Fixes

- Replace "Submit" with specific action ("Save Changes", "Create Account")
- Add inline validation instead of only on submit
- Show progress for multi-step flows
- Make primary action visually prominent
